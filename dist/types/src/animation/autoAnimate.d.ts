     * Captures a pair of "before" and "after" snapshots of the given shapes' schemas
     * by invoking the provided `flushDraw` function twice.
     *
     * This enables automatic animations to be generated by diffing the two states.
     *
     * @param ids - The IDs of shapes to track during this animation frame.
     * @param flushDraw - A function that triggers a draw cycle. This is called:
     *   - once immediately to capture the "before" state, and
     *   - again inside the returned `finalize()` function to capture the "after" state.
     *
     * @returns A function that, when called, finalizes the capture and triggers animation.
     *
     * @example
     * const finalize = autoAnimate.captureFrame(ids, () => draw());
     * mutateShapes();
     * finalize(); // triggers animation between captured states
